# Filtering Variational Objectives Implementation 
- Pytorch implementation of **Filtering Variational Objectives (FIVO)**.
- This repository is created for KAIST AI701 project. (Team 19 : HyengJoo Hwang, Seokin Seo, Yunseon Choi, see our project proposal [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dkcdjbqbgcbz).)
- This repository is based on [VRNN pytorch implementation](https://github.com/emited/VariationalRecurrentNeuralNetwork).
- The original paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09279.pdf).
- Reparameterized (relaxed) resampling is not supported yet.

## Run:

To train: ``` python train.py ```
